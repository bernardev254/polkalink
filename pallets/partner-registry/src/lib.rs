I understand you have a comprehensive DataLink Network project concept for a decentralized partner data layer built on Polkadot SDK. This is an excellent use case for a custom blockchain that addresses real industry pain points around data sharing, verification, and trust.

Let me help you build a foundational implementation of DataLink Network with the core pallets and a demonstration interface. This will include the essential components: partner registration, data verification, access control, and a basic governance system.
