I understand you have a comprehensive project proposal for DataLink Network, but I notice there seems to be a technical issue with the repeated "continue your prior response" messages. Let me provide you with a fresh response to help you build this exciting decentralized data collaboration platform.

DataLink Network is a compelling use case for Polkadot SDK - creating a consortium blockchain for transparent supply chain data sharing is exactly the type of problem that benefits from custom runtime logic and cross-chain interoperability.

Let me help you build a foundational implementation to demonstrate the core concepts:
