I understand you have a comprehensive project concept for DataLink Network - a decentralized partner data layer built on Polkadot SDK for transparent collaboration in supply chains. This is an excellent use case for a custom blockchain that addresses real industry pain points around data fragmentation, verification, and trust.

Let me help you build a foundational implementation to demonstrate the core concepts. I'll create a Substrate-based blockchain with custom pallets for partner registration, data verification, and access control.
